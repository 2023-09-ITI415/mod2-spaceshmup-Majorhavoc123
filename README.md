 The changes I had made to this game involved a few things. I had tweaked some variables in the system (the speed of the ship and the damage of weapons),
 but that was not my primary goal with this project. What I did was I added a UI systems that tracks both current score and your highscore.
 This highscore is also saved between playthroughs so you can try to beat it over time without having to worry about leaving the application open.
